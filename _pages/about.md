## About Me
I am a software engineer and information security expert with over ten years of experience. Seeing that on paper certainly tickles the part of my brain where the imposter syndrome dwells, however it is undeniably trueâ€“technically speaking.

From humble beginnings writing software to automate rather _unexciting_ tasks, to testing and documenting the security of enterprise systems, and finally writing software to encrypt and cleverly manage the encryption keys, I have had the opportunity to write, test, and deploy some interesting applications. In this website, you'll find some of the (hopefully) interesting things I've discovered and developed.

Feel free to send me feedback, although try to be gentle as my ego is as fragile as the portability of the code samples.
